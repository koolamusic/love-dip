# Love Dip

So you wanna host a lovefeast, however participants need to dip and select their pairs randomly, as well as secretly. No one is supposed to know another person's pair.
This App is built with NextJs and uses Airtable as the Database.

- Users can set a secret code
- Users can Generate their pair randomly (using some lodash helpers)
- Users can Generate Random Pairs only (3times) to avoid abuse.

## Prerequisites

- You need `git` installed locally
- You need `Nodejs` and `npm` installed
- You need a Code Editor (Vscode, webstorm, Atom) etc

```sh

git clone https://github.com/koolamusic/love-dip
$ cd love-dip
$ npm install
$ npm run dev

```
